**Data-Driven Restaurant Insights in Copenhagen**  
*An AI-Powered Tool for Optimal Restaurant Location Selection and Business Longevity*

## 🚀 Objective

Opening a restaurant is a high-risk endeavor—many establishments close within their first few years. In Copenhagen, aspiring restaurateurs and investors often lack a data-driven approach when selecting a location. Moreover, understanding the reasons behind a restaurant’s success or failure remains a challenge.

This project aims to:

- Recommend optimal locations for new restaurants.
- Visualize location suitability through an interactive heatmap.
- Provide insights and guidelines to enhance restaurant longevity using survival analysis.
